/**
 *
 * Kth Closest Point To <0,0,0>
 *
 Description
 
 Given three arrays sorted in ascending order. Pull one number from each array to form a coordinate <x,y,z>
 in a 3D space. Find the coordinates of the points that is k-th closest to <0,0,0>.

 We are using euclidean distance here.

 Assumptions

 The three given arrays are not null or empty
 K >= 1 and K <= a.length b.length c.length
 Return

 a size 3 integer list, the first element should be from the first array, the second element should be from the second array and the third should be from the third array
 Examples

 A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {2, 4}, C = {3, 6}

 The closest is <1, 2, 3>, distance is sqrt(1 + 4 + 9)

 The 2nd closest is <3, 2, 3>, distance is sqrt(9 + 4 + 9)
