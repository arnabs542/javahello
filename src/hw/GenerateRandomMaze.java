/**
 * 
 * Randomly generate a maze of size N * N (where N = 2K + 1) whose corridor and
 * wall¡¯s width are both 1 cell. For each pair of cells on the corridor, there
 * must exist one and only one path between them. (Randomly means that the
 * solution is generated randomly, and whenever the program is executed, the
 * solution can be different.). The wall is denoted by 1 in the matrix and
 * corridor is denoted by 0.
 * 
 * Assumptions
 * 
 * N = 2K + 1 and K >= 0 
 * the top left corner must be corridor 
 * there should be as many corridor cells as possible 
 * for each pair of cells on the corridor, there
 * must exist one and only one path between them 
 * 
 * Examples
 * 
 * N = 5, one possible maze generated is
 * 
 * 0 0 0 1 0
 * 
 * 1 1 0 1 0
 * 
 * 0 1 0 0 0
 * 
 * 0 1 1 1 0
 * 
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 * 
 * 0 - path
 * 1 - wall
 * 
 * Hard Depth First Search
